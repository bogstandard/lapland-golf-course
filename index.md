## Welcome to the club

Here we'll display your golfing scores. Contact your local club president if you'd like to join or attach your portrait. These should scores update automatically, so long as the player keeps their `.scorecard` file up to date!

Click on a row name to display the player's solution!

### How to play

Put a `.scorecard` file in the directory you'll be golfing from & fill it out as you go. Here is [an example](https://github.com/bogstandard/lapland-golf-club/blob/main/Keeper/.scorecard) for a fictional player named _Keeper_.

Within your `.scorecard` you'll list your submissions in a format like below, lines beginning with `@` or `//` or `#` are ignored:

```
@ Bogstandard
# Awaiting the frost
Day One: scorekeeper.test
Day Two: example-day/example-file.test
```

Then provide your local club president with a link to your `.scorecard` in your public repository & they'll do the rest! Your `.scorecard` doesn't need to be in the same repository as the club!

### How do I establish my own club?

Please speak with the [groundskeeper](https://github.com/bogstandard/) about this or copy this repo! Take a look at the `_config.yml` file and you should figure it out if you've got smarts.
